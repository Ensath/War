# The Game of War

Running this application will produce the game of war. The rules are as follows:

Each player starts with half of a randomized standard deck of 52 playing cards. Players reveal the top card of their decks. If one is of higher value, the player with that card takes both cards, putting them on the bottom of their deck in a random order. Aces are high. If the two cards are of the same value, both players place a card face down, then reveal another card from their decks. If a player has a higher card, they take all the cards on the table, otherwise the process repeats. The game ends when one player runs out of cards, with that player losing and the other player winning.

The above describes rules for a two player game. For more players, divide the deck evenly among the players to begin. Compare cards from all players when revealing from the deck. All players place a card face down, then reveal another card from their decks when two or more cards tie for highest. The game ends when one player has all the cards, with losing players dropping out. (Source: https://www.pagat.com/war/war.html)
